	///					For most geocoding requests, this array should contain only one entry.
	///					However, forward-geocoding requests may return multiple placemark objects in situations where
	///					the specified address could not be resolved to a single location.

	///					placemark were found.

	///   - success:	callback to execute on success. For most geocoding requests, this array should contain only one entry.
